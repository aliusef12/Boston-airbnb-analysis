# Boston-airbnb-analysis
This is an analysis of the boston airbnb data set on kaggle for project 1 of the udacity data science nano degree The data set has information about the listings on airbnb in Boston and a time series data frame showing the occupancy of each listing in this analysis I attempted to understand the factores that make the listings popular and if the reviews are genuinely related to the popularity of each listing .
**
Questions asked:**

- What are the most popular listings ?
- what attributes effect popularity most ?
- are popularity and reviews related ?
- can we predict price inorder to give customers an expected price for there requests?

Files In thie repo:
- The readme file for documentation purposes
- The Data science nano degree project 1 python notebook containing all the code and the analysis

in this project I use a couple of different data science libraries mainly pandas, seaborn and sickit learn This repository has oen file containing the code from the jupyter notebook where the analysis was done.


Summary and findings:

- we found the top ten most popular listings and further analysis to why there occupanvy rate is high can prove beneficial further more we can give them benefits in order to insetivise other hosts
- not one feature alone effects the occupancy rate, It's a combination of all features of the listing but one of the most correllated features was review number and that could be due to the fact that since reviews tend to be negative the more reviews the more negative rep the listings get
- good reviews definetley increase popularity but they don't have the biggest efect meaning that alot of other factors play a role in popularity of listing
- prices can be modelled by the listings feature to a certain degree of accuracy and the feature itself can be helpful for users looking for certain listings to expect a price range
